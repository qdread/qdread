### About Q

I'm [Quentin](http://quentinread.com), data scientist and ecologist. 
I'm the [Southeast Area](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/) Statistician for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, located on the campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
I work with datasets about everything from Georgia peaches :peach: to Hawaiian bees :honeybee: to Arkansas groundwater :ocean: to Florida sugarcane :lollipop:!
I joined USDA in October 2021. Check out my [USDA stats and R tutorial page](https://quentinread.com/SEAStats) and my [official USDA GitHub profile](https://github.com/QuentinRead-USDA)!
