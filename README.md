### About Q

I'm [Quentin](http://quentinread.com), data scientist and ecologist. 
Currently I'm the [Southeast Area](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/) Statistician for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
I joined USDA in October 2021. Check back here soon to read more about the new projects I'm getting started!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on promoting Bayesian statistics, high-performance computing, and open reproducible science among USDA agricultural researchers. On the side I maintain the [rslurm R package](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/rslurm). In the past I've analyzed datasets ranging from [forest growth in Panama](https://github.com/qdread/forestscalingworkflow) to [USA-wide food waste](https://github.com/qdread/halvingfoodwaste) to [breeding bird surveys](https://github.com/qdread/nasabio).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about bioinformatics, statistical learning methods, publishing reproducible data science workflows, and building up my [Stan](https://mc-stan.org)-fu skills.
