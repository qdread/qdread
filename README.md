### About Q

I'm [Quentin](http://quentinread.com), data scientist and ecologist. 
Currently I'm the Southeast area Statistician for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
I'm just getting started with this new position (October 2021) so please check back here soon to read more about the new projects I'm getting started!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on maintaining the [rslurm R package](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/rslurm) and analyzing datasets ranging from [forest growth in Panama](https://github.com/qdread/forestscalingworkflow) to [USA-wide food waste](https://github.com/qdread/halvingfoodwaste) to [breeding bird surveys](https://github.com/qdread/nasabio).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about statistical learning methods, publishing reproducible data science workflows, and trying to pick up some Julia on the side.
